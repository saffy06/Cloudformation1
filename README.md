# Cloudformation1
The provided AWS CloudFormation template is written in YAML and defines a basic infrastructure for an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) along with related resources
Here's a brief overview of the key components in the template:

Parameters:

VpcCidrBlock: A parameter to specify the CIDR block for the VPC. The default value is '10.0.0.0/16'.
Resources:

MyVPC:

Type: 'AWS::EC2::VPC'
Properties: Creates a VPC with the specified CIDR block, DNS support, DNS hostnames enabled, and tags.
InternetGateway:

Type: 'AWS::EC2::InternetGateway1' (Note: The type seems to be incorrect, it should be 'AWS::EC2::InternetGateway')
Properties: Creates an Internet Gateway with a name tag.
AttachGateway:

Type: 'AWS::EC2::VPCGatewayAttachment1' (Note: The type seems to be incorrect, it should be 'AWS::EC2::VPCGatewayAttachment')
Properties: Attaches the Internet Gateway to the VPC.
MySecurityGroup:

Type: 'AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup'
Properties: Defines a security group allowing SSH access from anywhere.
PrivateSubnet:

Type: 'AWS::EC2::Subnet'
Properties: Creates a private subnet within the VPC with a specified CIDR block and availability zone.
MyEC2Instance:

Type: 'AWS::EC2::Instance'
Properties: Launches an Amazon EC2 instance in the private subnet with a specified instance type, security group, Amazon Machine Image (AMI), and key pair.
Note: The template has a couple of issues in the resource types (AWS::EC2::InternetGateway1 and AWS::EC2::VPCGatewayAttachment1). These should be corrected to AWS::EC2::InternetGateway and AWS::EC2::VPCGatewayAttachment respectively.

Additionally, the !Select and !GetAZs functions are used to select an availability zone dynamically. The !Ref function is used to reference parameter values and resource names. The provided AMI ID corresponds to the Amazon Linux 2 AMI, and the key pair named 'vockey' is specified for SSH access to the EC2 instance.
